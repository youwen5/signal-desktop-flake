# Signal Desktop for aarch64-linux

> [!WARNING]
> `signal-desktop` in `nixpkgs` has now been updated to use the same COPR
> source this repository uses since
> [#384032](https://nixpk.gs/pr-tracker.html?pr=384032). It is no longer
> necessary, just use `nixpkgs`. Additionally, the electron bug has been fixed.
> If any issues arise with the `nixpkgs` package in the future, this repo may
> be updated again.
